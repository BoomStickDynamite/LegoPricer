Lego Lot Pricer
Documentation

How did you approach (get started with) this assignment?
I started by typing pseudo code for how I wanted to retrieve the price.  I also used
urllib for the first time, so I had to research and import that.  After typing my
pseudo code, I was just randomly coding small parts of the project, and eventually
got it to work with a N and U indicator and the ability to enter each set individually

How did you test your program?
Learning from my last assignment, I tested the program by running it in IDLE, and set
print markers in the code so I could see if the data was being processed and handed off from
step to step.  This made it a lot easier to understand any error messages.

What works and what doesn't work?
The lot pricing works, and I've updated it to accept a batch of lots from a text file.
What doesn't work is that you have to manually set if the lot is used or new.
Also, I want to put a front scraper to scrape the Ebay listing and find the set numbers
automatically.  Also, I need to use API instead of scraping through html code because
it will increase performance, ensure accuracy, and allow flexibility.

What did you learn from this assignment? What would you do differently next time?

I learned that when designing a project for a person, it is very important to understand
where they are starting (ebay listing) and what they want to get to.  Also, it is
very important to understand the output data (price) and where to get it, because I spent
some time getting data from the wrong page.  Next time, I would have him walk me through his
whole process before automating it.  Also, I will write cleaner code next time, comment
while I go, test in IDLE, use documentation as I go, and upload all versions to Git.
